# Monthly Bills

I live with two roommates currently, and although we have three utility bills and three people, I myself have two of the utilities in my name (Electric, and internet), while one of my roommates has the other utility in their name(Gas), and the third roommate doesn't have a utility in their name.

It is a bit of a hassle to calculate the total each person owes eadch month so I thought this would be the perfect task to automate.

Although not a terribly hard scenario to figure out it was a great excercise putting a mathematical equation I came up with into code.
